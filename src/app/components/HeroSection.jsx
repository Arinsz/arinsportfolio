            I started by ordering computer parts and building computers when I
            was young, and I found it very exciting to learn all about how
            computers are built and which hardware components work best
            together.
            <br /> Since then, my interest in hardware, software, networking,
            and gaming within IT has grown. I have decided that I want to work
            in IT because that is where my interest and curiosity are the
            greatest.
